### Front end built using:

#### React

- Facebook maintains and continues to improve this framework.
- 99% backwards compatibility compared to Vues's 90%.
- In consideration of who will most likely work on Groa in the future, we thought React would be easy to jump in the code base.

üö´List the rest of the front end features and libraries in the same format as the framework above.

#### Front end deployed to `AWS Amplify`

#### [Back end](https://api.groa.us/) built using:

#### Express

- Accessible documentation
- Good error handling
- Faster to implement than vanilla Node.js

üö´ List the rest of the back end end features and libraries in the same format as the framework above

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_ANALYTICS_ID - this is your Google analytics key, which can be generated in the Google Analytics Console.
